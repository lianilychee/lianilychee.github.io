            <!-- Hey there,

            I'm an experience designer who enjoys exploring complex problems to create simple solutions. Since there's rarely a 'simple' solution, I value 1) clearly summarizing the assumptions and logic behind design decisions and 2) establishing relevant feedback loops so we can test, learn, and improve.

            In a typical project, I might do some or all of the following: research history & context, analyze & visualize data, talk to users & stakeholders, ideate with wireframes, validate hypotheses with user testing, iterate with mockups & prototypes, summarize design logic, set up relevant feedback loops, and tie all this into longer-term strategy. Although I can take projects from concept to completion, I work best with collaborative teams that are open-minded and diverse.

            In college, I studied computer science, art, and philosophy. For work, I've done product management, UX design, web development, and branding/marketing. Recently, I joined the first class of the Harvard Master in Design Engineering program to explore the application (and limitations) of software for social problems. For more on my work experience, please go to LinkedIn.

            Outside of work, I enjoy nature (hiking, skiing), culture (couchsurfing, backpacking), and art (visual, music, film, literature). Here's what I've been reading, drawing, and experiencing. 

            Please message me if you have book recommendations, project ideas, or just want to chat. Thanks for visiting. Have a good one! -->

            <p>Status: Page last updated July 2017.</p>

            <p>Hi!  I'm Liani.  

            I'm a robotics engineering senior at <a href='http://www.olin.edu/'>Olin College</a> just outside Boston, and I am the multitool that holds teams and projects together.</p>

            <p>I enjoy forging new paths in unfamiliar territory, and this past year has been a series of "firsts":

            <ul>
                <li> First co-op hired at <a href='www.ivani.com/network-presence-sensing.html' target='_blank'>Ivani</a>, a St. Louis startup.  My software work has resulted in a provisional patent application.
                <li> Launched <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jS-HU6fEUJcHPEOgohch7nQQ6U6QToGihHJPInDOaeA/edit'>Foundry Idea Testing (FIT)</a>, Olin's first ever winter-session program - and a student-run one to boot.
                <li> First operations hire at <a href='tagup.io> target='_blank'>Tagup</a>, a Greentown Labs startup.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <p>Within robotics, my field of study, I've learned the joys of ROS (Robot Operating System), co-opting modified Neatos to create swarms <a href='https://github.com/lianilychee/project_polygon/wiki'>(Project Polygon)</a> and autonomous cars <a href='https://github.com/lianilychee/project_caribou'>(Project Caribou)</a>.  Outside class, in my freshman and sophomore years, I could be found performing composite layups, characterizing sensors, or developing system architecture, all with the aim of building a sailboat to autonomously traverse the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

            <p>Outside engineering, I draw <a href='projects/prototyping.html'>comics</a> to express information with visually compelling narratives, and I spent time at Babson's social innovation lab, <a href='http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/the-lewis-institute/about/Pages/home.aspx' target='_blank'>The Lewis Institute</a>.</p>

            <!-- <p>I enjoy applying my technical skills to direct-impact, socially-minded projects.  This past semester, I embarked upon a <a href='http://tinyurl.com/olinstpp'>sociology flavored, data-driven exploration of the disability's role in the school-to-prison pipeline</a>.  My work last summer was a foray into the intersection between education and technology.  I mentored three middle-school-aged young ladies from the Bronx to develop <a href='projects/engen.html'>a scooter accessory for mobile device charging</a>, patent pending.</p>  -->

            <!-- <p>Engineering-side, the bulk of my experience has been in designing and integrating electromechanical systems for new product development.  As the engineering lead for one of my ongoing projects, the development of a newborn warmer to augment phototherapy, I am constantly balancing blue-sky design goals with realistic manufacturing capabilities and medical device certification requirements.  Iâ€™ve also worked alongside my team to dig deep into Solidworks and COMSOL modeling.</p> -->
