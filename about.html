            <p>Hi!  I'm Liani - the multitool that holds teams and projects together.  

            <p>For any given project, I can be found doing any or all of the following: 

            <ul>
                <li>mapping context and key assumptions;</li>
                <li>crafting understanding, validating hypotheses, and co-creating - all through stakeholder interviews;</li>
                <li>driving design with iterative mockups & prototypes;</li>
                <li>setting up milestones and metrics;</li>
                <li>and crafting all of the above into project strategy. 
            </ul>

            <!-- <p>[Although I can take projects from concept to completion, I work best with collaborative teams that are open-minded and diverse.]</p> -->

            <p>I've just graduated from <a href='http://www.olin.edu/'>Olin College</a>, where I define the time I spent there by a series of firsts, including:

            <ul>
                <li> Hired as St. Louis startup <a href='www.ivani.com/network-presence-sensing.html' target='_blank'>Ivani's</a> first co-op, where my software work net a provisional patent application.
                <li> Launched <a href='https://vimeo.com/212311989/c22490095c'>Foundry Idea Testing (FIT)</a>, Olin's first inaugural and student-run winter-session program.
                <li> Led my school's Global Health team through its first year as technical leader turned project manager.
                <!-- <li>First operations hire at <a href='tagup.io> target='_blank'>Tagup</a>, a Greentown Labs startup. -->
                </p>
            </ul>

            <!-- Hey there,

            I'm an experience designer who enjoys exploring complex problems to create simple solutions. Since there's rarely a 'simple' solution, I value 1) clearly summarizing the assumptions and logic behind design decisions and 2) establishing relevant feedback loops so we can test, learn, and improve.


            In college, I studied computer science, art, and philosophy. For work, I've done product management, UX design, web development, and branding/marketing. Recently, I joined the first class of the Harvard Master in Design Engineering program to explore the application (and limitations) of software for social problems. For more on my work experience, please go to LinkedIn.

            Outside of work, I enjoy nature (hiking, skiing), culture (couchsurfing, backpacking), and art (visual, music, film, literature). Here's what I've been reading, drawing, and experiencing. 

            Please message me if you have book recommendations, project ideas, or just want to chat. Thanks for visiting. Have a good one! -->

            <p>Recreationally, I enjoy cooking, drawing, and reading.

            <!-- <p>I enjoy applying my technical skills to direct-impact, socially-minded projects.  This past semester, I embarked upon a <a href='http://tinyurl.com/olinstpp'>sociology flavored, data-driven exploration of the disability's role in the school-to-prison pipeline</a>.  My work last summer was a foray into the intersection between education and technology.  I mentored three middle-school-aged young ladies from the Bronx to develop <a href='projects/engen.html'>a scooter accessory for mobile device charging</a>, patent pending.</p>  -->

            <!-- <p>Engineering-side, the bulk of my experience has been in designing and integrating electromechanical systems for new product development.  As the engineering lead for one of my ongoing projects, the development of a newborn warmer to augment phototherapy, I am constantly balancing blue-sky design goals with realistic manufacturing capabilities and medical device certification requirements.  Iâ€™ve also worked alongside my team to dig deep into Solidworks and COMSOL modeling.</p> -->

            <p>Take care!</p>
