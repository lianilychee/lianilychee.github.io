		<div class="story">
			TITLE <br> <br>

			<p> Engineering Design & Development (EDD) is the <a href="http://lbcams.schoolloop.com" target="_blank" class="folioLink">California Academy of Math & Science (CAMS)</a> capstone course that provides high-school seniors with true-to-life industry experience. The class, split into two independent but competing 16-member firms, is given ten months to design, fabricate, and test from scratch a robot that fits the year's challenge. This year, we were tasked to develop a 6kg polymorphic robot with the capability to perform multiple tasks of value. Team performance is based on five checkpoints throughout the year, called Critical Design Reviews. </p>

			<p> I had the privilege of serving as the Project Manager of one of the teams, Delta Technologies. We chose the military as the target audience because we wanted to prevent soldier casualties. As designers, we started by researching - talking to people in the military field. We discovered that real-time information is the most valuable asset on the field, so we structured our robot and tasks around improving military reconnaissance. Our goal of developing a robot capable of both land and air travel for better recon capabilities led us to investigate dibond, a light yet strong aluminum composite, as chassis material and we became the first team in EDD history to achieve stable flight. </p>

			<p> As an entrepreneurial undertaking, we realized early-on that the scope we were striving to achieve would exceed the $1,500 budget. We were the first team in course history that worked to solicit outside donations from both for- and non-profit organizations, and we earned over $2,000, and roughly $1,000 of which consisted of donated printing and manufacturing services. </p>

			<p> At the end of the year, during the final Critical Design Review, Mission Performance, Delta Technologies' robot, dubbed Mercury, was able to succesfully perform the reconnaisance tasks we had set out to do: perform aerial room mapping, wirelessly transmit live video feed, detect a simulated mine, detect movement with discreet deployable modules. </p>

			<p> I have had many incredible experiences at CAMS, but EDD is the one that I am most proud of because it was a culmination of all my engineering projects thus far, and a test of everything I had learned in the past four years. I learned three important lessons as Project Manager: </p>

			<ol>
				<li> Leadership - and really, collaboration in general - is not about "my way or the highway." Large-scale projects require every single team member to be invested in the project, which means all input must be valued and seriously considered. </li> <br> <br>

				<li>The ability to adapt to each member's work habits - striking the balance between micro- and macro- management and accepting individuals' quirks - is essential to building a positive team dynamic. So is the ability to identify and capitalize upon each team member's strengths, and to provide mentorship and training in weak skill sets when necessary.</li> <br> <br>

				<li>Despite being one of two girls on a 16-member team, gender does not indicate one's level of knowledge.</li>
			</ol>
