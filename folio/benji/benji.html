		<h1>BENJI TO THE RESCUE!</h1>

		<p> Benji the Beaver is the product of six weeks' hard work with a team of three other Olin students and two <a href='http://www.babson.edu/Pages/default.aspx'>Babson</a> students.  The purpose of Design Nature: Project Transporters was to design and develop an engaging bio-inspired animal-based game for elementary school children, with the final judgement actually passed by local fourth-graders.</p>

		<p>Players used a remote controller to navigate Benji around a pool to retrieve logs, which were used to build a dam in order to save Benji's pup.  From a user experience perspective, the game was multifaceted and captivating.  And from a mechanism design perspective, despite (or perhaps because of - discouragement from the teaching team to pursue a water toy) having a successful Benji was very rewarding.</p>
