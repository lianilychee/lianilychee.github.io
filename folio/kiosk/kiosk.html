		<h1>OUTREACH DESIGN: THE FOOD PROJECT KIOSK</h1>

		<p>In Anthropology: The Human Connection, five of my peers and I worked with a Tufts University graduate student to develop a mobile information kiosk for The Food Project.  <a href='http://thefoodproject.org/'>The Food Project (TFP)</a> is a Massachusetts organization that aims to make healthy, affordable produce accessible to working-class neighborhoods.  </p>

		<p>This design project was my first in which the final deliverable was a mockup, rather than a prototype.  Without the pressure of developing a flawless functional product, I found myself able to delve into the finer details - understanding the target audiences and their needs, as well as formulating use cases - that make up good design. </p>

		<p>The final kiosk concept is based off the following key characteristics: mobility, versatility, interactiveness, durability, and presentatiblity.  Each characteristic is addressed through thoughtful consideration of material used and fabrication techniques.</p>

		<!-- <p>The kiosk had five key characteristics:  </p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Mobility</b>. TFP is a low-staff organization.  The kiosk needs to be easily transported and set up by a single person.</li><br>

			<li><b>Versatility</b>.  The kiosk needed to be effective in multiple environments, from a sidewalk display to an indoor presentation aid.</li><br>
		
			<li><b>Interactiveness</b></li><br>

			<li>Durability</li><br>

			<li>Presentability</li><br>
		</ul> -->
