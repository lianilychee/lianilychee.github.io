		<div class="story">
			Olin Robotic Sailing <br> <br>

			<p> I am the mechanical subteam leader for Olin's Robotic Sailing team.  The goal is to develop a boat capable of autonomously traversing the Atlantic Ocean.  This boat can then act as a platform for marine research. </p>s

			<p> I developed a new transmission system for the jib, one of the sails.  Previously, the jib and the main were powered through a single string and winch system, which, besides not being responsive enough, would frequently tangle.  I used a belt-and-pulley system to independently run the jib and the main.  Each sail is powered by a AX-108 Dynamixel motor (SPECS OF THE DYNA needed). </p>

			<p> I also worked sensing the wind force on the sails.  I worked with a load cell and created a prototype to mount below the deck. </p>
