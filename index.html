        <!-- tagline -->
        <p>I toe the line that divides code and physical systems, and that points to products that help people in novel and useful ways.</p>
        
        <!-- about -->
        <p>I organize cross-functional teams to tackle high-impact projects.</p>

        <!-- organize teams-->
        <p>I organize.  First taste of project management as the Project Manager of my high school senior capstone, when I organized a 16-member team and $1500 budget.  Since then, I've worked nominally as the team lead / scrum master for most of my teams in college.</p>

        <!-- work cross-functionally -->
        <p>I work cross-functionally.  A robotics engineer by training, I've crafted my curriculum to include the most system integration, forcing me to become proficient across disciplines.  An example:  taking a semester off to work at a software company, though code is not the language that I speak.</p>

        <!-- tackle high-impact projects -->
        <p>I tackle high-impact projects, shining spotlights on the inconsistencies of... stuff.  School-to-prison pipeline, Cultural Conversations come to mind.</p>

<!--         <p>Hi!  I'm Liani.  I'm a robotics engineering junior at <a href='http://www.olin.edu/'>Olin College</a> in Greater Boston.  From January to August 2016, I'll be working on presence sensing as Member #9 at <a href='http://www.ivani.com/n-way-technology.html'>Ivani</a> in St. Louis.  The specifics are rather hush hush, but I've been learning and doing loads.

        <p>I enjoy applying my technical skills to direct-impact, socially-minded projects.  This past semester, I embarked upon a <a href='http://tinyurl.com/olinstpp'>sociology flavored, data-driven exploration of the disability's role in the school-to-prison pipeline</a>.  My work last summer was a foray into the intersection between education and technology.  I mentored three middle-school-aged young ladies from the Bronx to develop <a href='projects/engen.html'>a scooter accessory for mobile device charging</a>, patent pending.  

        <p>In terms of robotics, my field of study, I've discovered the joys of ROS (Robot Operating System), co-opting modified Neatos to create swarms <a href='https://github.com/lianilychee/project_polygon/wiki'>(Project Polygon)</a> and autonomous cars <a href='https://github.com/lianilychee/project_caribou'>(Project Caribou)</a>.  Outside class, I can be found performing composite layups, characterizing sensors, or developing system architecture, all with the aim of building a sailboat to autonomously traverse the Atlantic Ocean.

        <p>Outside engineering, I am working on increasing diversity at Olin, both through shifts in policy and by hosting <a href='https://lianilychee.wordpress.com/category/culture-chats/'>Cultural Conversations</a>.  Cultural Conversations are student-body-wide chats that increase campus awareness and organic discussion around ethnic and cultural diversity both inside and outside the scope of the school. -->
