        <p>CARDBOARD CARPENTRY

        <p>Foraying into adaptive design, I enjoy crafting cardboard adaptations to enhance my life.  <b><i>Each piece is a study on intentional structural folds, woodworking joints*, and minimal cardboard use.</b></i>

        <p>* Each of my pieces can be unfolded and flattened, making storage a breeze.  Using glue and hardware would be antithetical to cardboard's impermanence and ease of assembly, so I don't.

        <h1 id='deskstool'>DESK AND STOOL</h1>
        My largest cardboard structures to date, the desk and stool are customized for my petite frame.  (I will do anything in my power to prevent back pain.)

        <h1 id='monitor'>MONITOR STAND</h1>
        <p> I made a pedestal to raise my monitor to the proper viewing height, reducing neck strain.

        <p> The trapezoidal frame prevents <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjr2c4d09wQ'>racking</a>.  The crossbrace, a straightforward rectangular insert, prevents deflection caused by the monitor's weight and acts as natural a natural shelf divider.

        <h1 id='toilet'>TOILETRY SHELF</h1>
        <p>To reduce sink clutter, I made a toiletry shelf on the first day of junior year to hold The Roommate's and my various hair and dental care products.  The shelf is suspended to a handrail with string.

        <h1 id='trusses'>TRUSSES FOR SUSPENDED LIGHTBULBS</h1>
        To add more lighting to the home, I built trusses to suspend light cords, both built in different ways.  Both trusses have notches in the top corner, preventing the light cord from sliding off.
        <p>Both trusses are attached to the wall with command stips, and suspended with cord and a command hook.
        <p>[missing image] kitchen truss
        <p>This truss is connected with a dovetail joint.  However, this led to deflection along that side of the truss, meaning more command strips.
        <p>[missing image] bedroom truss
        <p>To address the deflection, I did away with the dovetail joint.  I cut notches in all the corners and used tensioned cord to hold everything together.

        <h1 id='trashcan'>TRASHCAN</h1>
        I made a trashcan with a strip of scrap cardboard that measured 12" by 36".

        <h1 id='doorstop'>DOOR STOP</h1>
        <p> This is one is admittedly more cutesy than the rest.  The Roommate and I also cheated by using tape.  We'll make a better one next year.

        <h1 id='procedure'>PROCEDURE . . .</h1>
        <p>... that I used for more readily bending tri-wall cardboard.  (Note: It's incredibly difficult.)  This procedure was developed after much trial and error.
        <ol>
            <li>Mark location of fold.
            <li>Place another sheet of cardboard along line.
            <li>Using the back of a pen (or other blunt object, but the pen is already handy), score along the line by pressing very hard.
            <li>Using body-weight as an anchor, slip fingers under the to-be-bent cardboard and lift forcefully.
        </ol>
