        <h1>CARDBOARD CARPENTRY</h1>

        <p>Foraying into adaptive design, I enjoy crafting cardboard adaptations to enhance my life.  <b><u>Each piece is a study on intentional structural folds, woodworking joints*, and minimal cardboard use.</b></u>

        <p>* Each of my pieces can be unfolded and flattened, making storage a breeze.  Using glue and hardware would be antithetical to cardboard's impermanence and ease of assembly, so I don't.

        <h2 id='deskstool'>DESK AND STOOL</h2>

            <p>My largest cardboard structures to date, the desk and stool are customized for my petite frame.  (Bad ergonomics was the source of my suffering one summer.  I will now do anything in my power to prevent back pain.)</p>

        <h2 id='monitor'>MONITOR STAND</h2>

            <p> I made a pedestal to raise my monitor to the proper viewing height, reducing neck strain.</p>

            <img src='monitor-stand-overview.jpg' width='500px' class='width-control'>

            <p> The trapezoidal frame prevents <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjr2c4d09wQ'>racking</a>.  The crossbrace, a straightforward rectangular insert, prevents deflection caused by the monitor's weight and acts as natural a natural shelf divider.</p>

        <h2 id='toilet'>TOILETRY SHELF</h2>

            <p>To reduce sink clutter, I made a toiletry shelf on the first day of junior year to hold The Roommate's and my various hair and dental care products.  The shelf is suspended to a handrail with string.

            <p>[missing image] A detailed view of the shelf's construction + rationale behind each fold.</p>


        <h2 id='trusses'>SCONCES FOR SUSPENDED LIGHTBULBS</h2>

            <p>To add more lighting to the home, I built trusses to suspend light cords, both built in different ways.  Both trusses have notches in the top corner, preventing the light cord from sliding off.</p>

            <p>Both trusses are attached to the wall with command stips, and suspended with cord and a command hook.</p>

            <p>[missing image] kitchen truss</p>

            <p>This truss is connected with a dovetail joint.  However, this led to deflection along that side of the truss, meaning more command strips.</p>

            <p>[missing image] bedroom truss</p>

            <p>To address the deflection, I did away with the dovetail joint.  I cut notches in all the corners and used tensioned cord to hold everything together.</p>

        <h2 id='trashcan'>TRASHCAN</h2>

            <p>I made a trashcan with a strip of scrap cardboard that measured 12" by 36".</p>

        <h2 id='doorstop'>DOOR STOP</h2>

            <p> This is one is admittedly more cutesy than the rest.  The Roommate and I also cheated by using tape.  We'll make a better one next year.</p>

        <h2 id='procedure'>PROCEDURE . . .</h2>
            
            <p>... that I used for more readily bending tri-wall cardboard.  (Note: It's incredibly difficult.)  This procedure was developed after much trial and error.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Mark location of fold.</li>
                <li>Place another sheet of cardboard along line.</li>
                <li>Using the back of a pen (or other blunt object, but the pen is already handy), score along the line by pressing very hard.</li>
                <li>Using body-weight as an anchor, slip fingers under the to-be-bent cardboard and lift forcefully.</li>
            </ol>
