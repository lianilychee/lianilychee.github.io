        <h1>CLIFF EFFECTS MODELING TOOL</h1>

        <p style='margin: 0 20px 0 20px; padding: 0 20px 0 10px; border-left-style: dotted; border-width: 1px'>
        <b>cliff effect:</b> 
        You are receiving government benefits, and you get a raise. But now that your income is higher, you no longer make the cutoff for the benefits you receive. You may be taking home more money, but your situation is worse. Some of your benefits drop to nothing, or almost nothing. You've fallen off "the cliff."
        </p>

        <p>The result of a collaboration between <a href='http://www.prohope.org/about/'>Project Hope</a>, <a href='https://www.umb.edu/csp'>Center for Social Policy</a>, and <a href='http://www.codeforboston.org'>Code for Boston</a>, the tool models how much assistance a client would receive from various benefits programs.  With this previously missing quantitative understanding, Project Hope case workers are better equipped to do financial planning with their clients.</p>

        <h2>My Role: Project / Product Manager</h2>

        <p>When I joined this Code for Boston project in August 2017, it had been in motion for nine months.  At that point, user research and benefits eligibility research had been conducted, and a very scrappy front-end had been built.</p>

        <p>However, the volunteer team was <b>quickly losing members and direction</b> because of the team leads' sudden departure.  And, a recent meeting with the client revealed that <b>the tool needed to be totally redone</b>, because it was addressing the wrong concern as-it-stood, rendering former benefits eligibility research useless.</p>

        <p>To settle the turmoil, I quickly morphed my self-designated role as "designer" to include that of "product/project manager."  This meant there was little in the spectrum of high-level v. detail-oriented work I didn't do:  One moment would see me creating a mockup for a developer to follow; another, discussing the feature set for a particular milestone.</p>

        <h2>A Few Accomplishments</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Increased new member retention rate by 75%</b> <br>through simplifying onboarding process and immediately giving new members project easily actionable items</li><br>
            <li><b>Delivered MVP to client in 6 weeks after pivot</b><br> by moving team to agile methodologies</li><br>
            <li><b>Increased active work-time from 30min to 75min per person</b><br> by being an active facilitator and creating subteams</li>
        </ul>
