      <h1>STORYTELLING: DACA RECIPIENTS</h1>

      <h2>About the Project</h2>

        <p>
          <b><i>Duration:</i></b> September 2017 - December 2017<br>
          <b><i>Partner:</i></b> &nbspMassachusetts Attorney General's Office (AGO)
        </p>

        <p>The AGO was litigating against the federal administration, constructing a case to keep the Deferred Action for Childhoold Arrivals (DACA) program.  The AGO wanted to use anonymized anecdotes about the program's impact to drive their case.</p>

        <p>Our objective was to build a tool that allowed the AGO to conduct this community outreach so that responders were anonymous yet informative.</p>
        

      <h2>My Role: Team Lead</h2>

        <p>At Code for Boston, I led a team of 5 members whose backgrounds were primarily in software development.  <b><u>I kept the team and our work grounded in our stakeholders' needs</u></b> (AGO and DACA respondents' needs).</p>

        <p>I also called the AGO 2x a month to keep them updated on progress.</p>


      <h2>Challenges</h2>

        <h3 style='margin-top: 0px'>Time Constraint</h3>

          <p>DACA would be rescinded in early March 2018.  The project started in September 2017, leaving 5 months of runway.  That time window was  further restricted: The AGO needed as much time as possible to conduct outreach to vulnerable communities and to craft their case.</p>

          <p>Code for Boston projects were historically built in-house and from scratch.  However, brigade members only met 1x/week, for 2-3 hours apiece.  We would have to really push to build something bug-free and intuitive in an indeterminate window.</p>

        <h3>Differentiation and "What's in it for them?"</h3>

          <p>Based on personal experiences, long surveys were burdensome.  And irrespective of medium, surveys tended to look and were used similarly (Survey Monkey, Typeform, etc.).  How could our tool be much different?  Did it even have to?</p>

          <p>Plus, why should undocumented people fill in the AGO's survey?  The questions would be rather personal and invasive, so we had somehow to incentivize responders.</p>

        <h3>Usability and Simplicity</h3>

          <p>The AGO would need to be able to parse the qualitative data without Code for Boston's help (email consulting would burn precious time).</p>

          <p>Because the AGO was a legal and government outfit, they were not technologically savvy.  Whatever we handed over needed to be intuitive and familiar enough for the AGO to easily use.</p>

      <h2>Our Product</h2>

        <p><b><u>To address all the challenges, we decided to use a Google Form.</p>

        <p>The Google Form was pre-built, which meant we were able to spend our time on contextual issues like "What's in it for them?" and developing non-invasive questions, rather than developing software language and infrastructure.</b></u></p>

        <p>The Google Form outputted to a Google Spreadsheet.  The customized off-the-shelf solution had these advantages:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>Increased intuity:</b> Google Form's WSYIWYG functionality was well-suited for the partner's technological skill level.
            <li><b>Pre-built functionality:</b> By choosing an off-the-shelf solution, our team saved months of the partner's and our time,</li>
            <li><b>Easy maintainability:</b> The partner could modify survey questions themselves without our team as a dependency,</li>
            <li><b>Easy accessibility for AGO:</b> The data were already visualized and could be exported to an Excel spreadsheet for further inspection,</li>
            <li><b>Easy accessibility for DACA responders:</b> We made the survey short, simple, and non-threatening.  We also developed a Spanish version.  These two actions cast the audience net wide.</li>
          </ol>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>My job boiled down to answering two questions: Are we truly addressing stakeholders' needs? And, how will the solution be maintained?</p>

        <p>These two questions guide my thinking, allowing me to scope and fit the solution to the problem, instead of the other way around.  <b><u>By remaining thoughtful and user-centered, I was able to shape product direction and amplify our partner's impact.</u></b></p>

        <p>In January 2018, the federal administration moved to extend, not repeal, the DACA program.  As a result, the AGO did not gather anecdotes or use our tool.  However, the AGO determined they would use the technology we introduced for future advocacy cases requiring respondent anonymity.</p>
