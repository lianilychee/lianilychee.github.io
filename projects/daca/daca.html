        <ol>
            <li>Help the AGO understand their clients to litigate more effectively, and</li>
            <li>Build public support for the <a href='http://www.mass.gov/ago/news-and-updates/press-releases/2017/2017-09-06-defend-daca-program.html'>nationwide litigation against repealing DACA</a>.</li>
