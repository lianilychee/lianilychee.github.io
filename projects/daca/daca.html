      <h1>STORYTELLING: DACA RECIPIENTS</h1>

      <h2>About the Project</h2>

        <p><b><i>Duration:</i></b> September 2017 - December 2017<br>
        <b><i>Partner:</i></b> &nbspMassachusetts Attorney General's Office (AGO)</p>

        <p>We were to build a tool for the AGO to conduct community outreach and learn about undocumented people’s experiences with the DACA program.</p>

        <p>The AGO was constructing a case against the sitting administration regarding the rescinding of DACA.  The AGO's objective was to construct a case of humanity through the collected anecdotes.</p>

      <h2>My Role</h2>

        <p>I led a team of 5 members whose backgrounds were primarily in software development.  I kept the team and our work grounded in our stakeholders' needs.</p>

        <p>I also called the AGO about once a month for guidance and to keep them updated on progress.</p>


      <h2>Challenges</h2>

        <h3 style='margin-top: 0px'>Time Constraint</h3>

          <p>There were only 5 months until DACA was rescinded.  That time window was also further restricted: The AGO needed as much time as possible to conduct outreach to vulnerable communities and to craft their case.</p>

          <p>Code for Boston projects have historically been built in-house and from scratch.  However, brigade members only met 1x/week, for 2-3 hours apiece.  We would have to really push to build something bug-free and intuitive in an indeterminate window.</p>

        <h3>Differentiation and "Reward"</h3>

          <p>Based on our collective experiences as survey takers, long surveys were burdensome.  And surveys generally looked and were used similarly, regardless of medium (Survey Monkey, Typeform, etc.).  How could our tool be different?  Did it even have to?</p>

          <p>Plus, why should undocumented people fill in the AGO's survey?  The questions would be rather invasive, so we had to determine reasonable exchange rather than relying on goodwill for responses.</p>

        <h3>Usability and Simplicity</h3>

          <p>The AGO would need to be able to parse the qualitative data without Code for Boston's help (email consulting would burn precious time).</p>

          <p>The AGO was highly skilled in navigating the legal landscape, but as a government office, they were not technologically advanced.  Whatever we handed over needed to be intuitive and familiar enough for the AGO to easily use.</p>

      <h2>Our Product</h2>

        <p>To address all the challenges, we decided to use a Google Form.</p>

        <p>The Google Form was pre-built, which meant we were able to spend our time on contextual issues like "What's in it for them?" and developing non-invasive questions, rather than software language and infrastructure</p>

        <p>The Google Form outputted to a Google Spreadsheet.  This had the advantages of:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Saving time by already being pre-built,</li>
            <li>Saving time by cutting Code for Boston out of the loop upon handover, and</li>
            <li>Maintaining usability and simplicity by being familiar to the AGO.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>I kept the team focused on our stakeholders’ needs.  By doing so, we were able to keep the solution simple and accessible.  We saved time by declining more technically creative solutions, instead answering questions around context and impact instead of infrastructure.</p>

        <p>The AGO did not end up using the tool/questions that we developed because the President ended up extending the DACA program.
