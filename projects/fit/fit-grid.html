      <h1>FOUNDRY IDEA TESTING</h1>

      <h2>Filling the Entrepreneurial Education Gap</h2>

        <p style='text-align: center;'><i>Foundry = campus entrepreneurship group.</i></p>

        <p style='margin-bottom: 0px;'>
          <b><i>Duration:</i></b> July 2016 - January 2017<br>
          <b><i>Partner:</i></b> <a href='http://www.olin.edu/about/'>Olin College of Engineering</a>
        </p>

        <p>Foundry Idea Testing (FIT) had two parts:
          <ol>
            <li>Semester-long series that covered various parts of the product development processs, culminating in a</li>
            <li>Week-long intensive in which teams of students had test the viability of a product.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <p>FIT was inpired by Harvard Business School's 5x5x5 spring break program, in which 5 MBA students would explore 5 ideas over 5 days.</p>

        <p><u><strong>FIT provided a formal product & business development foundation and allowed them to rapidly test idea viability with real customers.  This addressed a gap in Olin's entrepreneurship education.</strong></u></p>

        <p>There were three existing pillars of entrepreneurship at Olin College: a required course, an extracurricular group, and the neighboring business school.  These options merely set up environments for students to learn and fail in isolation, but did not provide explicit mentor guidance.</p>

      <h2>My Role</h2>

        <p>This was the first time FIT had ever been executed at Olin.  <b><u>I was both an organizer and a participant.</u></b></p>

        <p>As an organizer, I was responsible for working with mentors to determine the speaker series curriculum, acquiring budget and permission from the college, and recruiting and organizing particpants.</p>

        <p>FIT was limited to 10 participants (2 teams).  There were three first-years, two juniors, and five seniors.  One student attended <a href='http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/Pages/default.aspx'>Babson College</a>, the neighboring business school.</p>

      <h2>FIT Component: Speaker Series</h2>

        <p>The speakers were industry-based.  The speaker series ran throughout the fall semester, and though it was by no means comprehensive, it was meant to give FIT participants a more formalized foundation of product development than the status quo "try it yourself" paradigm.</p>

        <p>The topics were:
          <ul>
            <li>Product management @ Olin 101</li> <!-- Ellen Chisa -->
            <li>Testing key assumptions</li> <!-- ADE students -->
            <li>Logo and business design</li> <!-- Tim Sauder -->
            <li>User testing</li> <!--Liz Cormack -->
          </ul>
        </p>

      <h2>FIT Component: Intensive</h2>

        <p>The intensive lasted 5 days over winter break.  The particpants were split into two teams of 5.  My team was comprised of 2 seniors, 1 junior, and 2 first-years - a balanced mix of practicality and idealism.</p>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>

        <p>These are some of my learnings, and I look forward to applying them in future work.</p>

        <h3>Business / product design takeaways</h3>

          <p><u><strong>Context > product.</strong></u>  Products (ex: PlayPump) cannot exist in isolation.  Contextual understanding drives use cases and users, which is critical to adoption.</p>

          <p><u><strong>"Do people want this?" Build products "Wizard of Oz" style to test desirability.</strong></u> Execute features manually to avoid spending time without feature validation.  This is also a useful way of learning more about context.</p>

        <h3>Organizing takeaways</h3>

          <p><u><strong>Delegate amongst participants at-large.</strong></u>  The organizing team was responsible for ALL the logistics.  However, FIT particpants later told us that they would have been willing to take on more of the organizing responsibility.</p>

          <p><u><strong>Set clear expectations</strong></u>, even within the organizing team.  Setting expectations would have distributed the load more evenly and knowlegeably.</p>
