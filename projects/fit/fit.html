      <h2>Filling the Entrepreneurial Education Gap</h2>

        <p style='text-align: center;'><i>Foundry = campus entrepreneurship group.</i></p>

        <p style='margin-bottom: 0px;'>
          <b><i>Duration:</i></b> July 2016 - January 2017<br>
          <b><i>Partners:</i></b> <a href='http://www.olin.edu/about/'>Olin College of Engineering</a>
        </p>

        <p>Foundry Idea Testing (FIT) had two parts:
          <ol>
            <li>Semester-long series that covered various parts of the product development processs, culminating in a</li>
            <li>Week-long intensive in which teams of students had test the viability of a product.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <p>FIT was inpired by Harvard Business School's 5x5x5 spring break program, in which 5 MBA students would explore 5 ideas over 5 days.</p>

        <p><u><strong>By giving students a formal business & product development foundation and allowing them to rapidly test idea viability with real customers, FIT addressed a gap in Olin's entrepreneurship education.</strong></u></p>

        <p>There were three existing pillars of entrepreneurship at Olin College: a required course, an extracurricular group, and the neighboring business school.  These options merely set up environments for students to learn and fail in isolation, but did not provide explicit mentor guidance.</p>

      <h2>My Role</h2>

        <p>This was the first time FIT had ever been executed at Olin.  I was both an organizer and a participant.</p>

        <p>As an organizer, I was responsible for working with mentors to determine the speaker series curriculum, acquiring budget and permission from the college, and recruiting and organizing particpants.</p>

        <p>FIT was limited to 10 participants (2 teams).  There were three first-years, two juniors, and five seniors.  One student attended <a href='http://www.babson.edu/about-babson/at-a-glance/Pages/default.aspx'>Babson College</a>, the neighboring business school.</p>

      <h2>FIT Component: Speaker Series</h2>

        <p>The speakers were industry-based.  The speaker series ran throughout the fall semester, and though it was by no means comprehensive, it was meant to give FIT participants a more formalized foundation of product development than the status quo "try it yourself" paradigm.</p>

        <p>The topics were:
          <ul>
            <li>Product management @ Olin 101</li> <!-- Ellen Chisa -->
            <li>Testing key assumptions</li> <!-- ADE students -->
            <li>Logo and business design</li> <!-- Tim Sauder -->
            <li>User testing</li> <!--Liz Cormack -->
          </ul>
        </p>

      <!-- <h2>Workshop: Testing Key Assumptions</h2> -->

      <h2>FIT Component: Intensive</h2>

        <p>The intensive lasted 5 days over winter break.  The particpants were split into two teams of 5.  My team was comprised of 2 seniors, 1 junior, and 2 first-years - a balanced mix of practicality and idealism.</p>

        These were the projects:

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Civic Toolkit</strong>:  Increasing interaction between citizens and local government officials.</li>
          <li><strong>Chime In</strong>: Allowing random people to connect (a la Chatroulette) but only through voice messages.</li>
          <li><strong>Cardboard Carpentry</strong>:</li>
          <li><strong>A Million Reasons Why</strong>:  </li>
          <li><strong>Startup Studio</strong>:  Spreading FIT to other schools, using the 5x5x5 model and introducing students to product development.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>

        <p>These are a couple of my takeaways.  There are too many to list them all!</p>

        <h3>Business / product design takeaways</h3>

          <p><u><strong>Business > product.</strong></u>  Contrary to personal philosophy, products do not have to be mission-driven to survive.  A viable business plan can keep a mediocre product afloat.  The opposite is not true.  After all, customers/users are needed.</p>

          <p><u><strong>"Do people want this?" Build products "Wizard of Oz" style to test desirability.</strong></u> Execute features manually to avoid sinking a lots of time into developing features without validating if people even want said product. (Example from the book <a href='http://theleanstartup.com/book'><i>Lean Startup</i></a>: A grocery planning service sent people to price compare before looking into APIs.)</p>

        <h3>Organizing takeaways</h3>

          <p><u><strong>Delegate amongst participants at-large.</strong></u>  The organizing team was responsible for all the logistics: setting curriculum, hammering out the budget, working with school offcials - the list goes on.  However after FIT was over, particpants told us that they would have been willing to take on more of the organizing responsibility.</p>

          <p><u><strong>Set clear expectations, even within the organizing team.</strong></u>  The organizers were four seniors, each with varying levels of commitment due to job search, grad school applications, etc.  It was a misconception that each person would go above and beyond to make FIT a reality.  Setting expectations would have distributed the load more evenly and knowlegeably.</p>
