      <h1>OTTER: NEWBORN WARMER FOR LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS</h1>

      <h2>About the Project</h2>

        <p style='margin-bottom: 0px;'>
          <b><i>Duration:</i></b> September 2016 - June 2017<br>
          <b><i>Partners:</i></b>

              <li> <a href='http://www.mtts-asia.com/'>Medical Technologies & Transfer Services (MTTS)</a> develops, manufactures, distributes, and supports low-cost neonatal devices to developing countries.</li>
              <li><a href='http://www.designthatmatters.org/'>Design that Matters (DtM)</a> DtM is a boutique design firm specializing in user experience and medical tech development.</li>

        </p>

        <p>Keeping newborns at safe temperatures is fraught: Newborns are very sensitive to temperature changes, and in low-resource countries particularly, hospitals do not necessarily have the equipment to do so while keeping contamination and infection at bay.</p>

        <p><strong><u>Otter is a durable warmer that streamlines and quickens other treatments by minimizing newborns’ risk of hypothermia and infections.</u></strong></p>

      <h2>The Team & My Role</h2>

        <h3>Team of 8 People</h3>

          <p>Our team was tasked to:
            <ul>
              <li>Make DtM's rudimentary proof-of-concept into a more functional and robust prototype,</li>
              <li>Get started on the CE Mark certifcation process, and</li>
              <li>Identify future markets for Otter penetration.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>The eight-member team comprised of engineering (bioengineering and other), design, and business students.</p>

          <!-- picture of Otter here??? -->

        <h3>My Role: Product / Project Manager</h3>

          <p>I joined the project in its first year.  The project had been DtM's and MTTS' brainchild, and we were brought in as technical expertise.</p>

          <p>On the product side, my job boiled down to two questions:  Are we building the right thing?  And, how do we maintain it?  Specific responsibilities included:
            <ul>
              <li>Determine where we would be at the end of each semester (vision),</li>
              <li>Work with subteam leads set intermediary milestones to reach that goal (strategy), and</li>
              <li>Buffer the team from "course overhead" roadblocks (execution)</li>
              <li>So we could focus on product reach (impact).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>On the project side, my job was to:
            <ul>
              <li>Organize team members,</li>
              <li>Ensure communication between subteams,</li>
              <li>Determine and ensure that the task/issue management platform stayed updated, and</li>
              <li>Maintain team culture trucking and keep the team happy.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <h2>Removing "Course Overhead"</h2>

        <div class='content-duo'>

          <img src='problem.png' class='content-right'>
          <!-- picture of assignment list -->

          <div class='content-left'>
            <p>The course had several required assignments, including: goals Powerpoint, periodic business / product design review presentations, end-of-semester reports.  These assignments were progress-critical, but through speaking with previous enrollees, <strong><u>I learned that teams historically would focus on these assignments at the expense of making progress on the product.</u></strong></p>

            <p>This didn't make sense to me.  I joined the project because in short, I believed in preserving infants' lives.  The assignments were supposed to aid progress, not hamper it.  However these assignments became centerpieces because they, not product progress, comprised the students' grades.</p>
          </div>

        </div>

        <p>So, I worked on changing my team's outlook.  I emphasized "Done is better than perfect."  Even though product mistakes had far greater consequences than Powerpoint ones, my team became more willing to actually working on the product.</p>

        <p>I also believed that the course assignments were a manifestation of the work we did, not the other way around.  By delegating and keeping meetings dedicated to product work, I limited the time spent on assignments and maximized the time spent on improving the product, and by proxy, fulfilling the mission.</p>


      <h2>Embedding Stakeholders in the <br>Development Process</h2>

        <p>It was critical to our team that we did not build Otter in isolation.  We wanted to understand the context - who, what, where, when, why, how - in which Otter would be used.  That way, we could propose and work on features that mattered.</p>

        <p>It is good practice to use stakeholder feedback to power development.  But more than that, we wanted to challenge the existing global health equipment paradigm.  Too often, Western countries would donate equipment without understanding that poorer countries did not necessarily have the infrastructure to properly use said equipment.</p>


        <h3>Vietnamese healthcare workers</h3>

          <p class='caption'>Pictured (middle).  At Yên Minh Hospital<br> explaining Otter to NICU doctors & nurses.</p>

          <p>We visited Vietnam twice: in January and in June, for 10-days each.  During each trip, we understood more about how the product would be integrated into hopsitals (by interviewing Vietnamese doctors, nurses, and procurement staff).</p>

          <p>Over the two trips, we visited 6 hospitals.  They ranged from right inside Hanoi city to the remote mountain ranges:
            <ul>
              <li>Hà Nam Provincial Hospital (twice)</li>
              <li>Nam Định Provincial Hospital (twice)</li>
              <li>"Hospital C", an urban hospital</li>
              <li>Hải Dương Provincial Hospital</li>
              <li>St. Paul Provincial Hospital</li>
              <li>Yên Minh Referral/District Hospital</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>Besides standard questions, we asked NICU healthcare workers to: draw their own device interfaces in order to understand what and describe the process- and device-based failure points they encountered.</p>

        <h3>MTTS: Manufacturer and distributor</h3>

          <p>MTTS was Otter's manufacturer, but as the technology's owners at the end of the day (MTTS would add Otter to their existing neonatal equipment suite), they were also responsible for distribution and support.  Besides weekly progress emails during the semesters, we also visited them in Hanoi (when we were not going to local hospitals).</p>

          <p>In our numerous workshops, some of the things we learned about included:
            <ul>
              <li>How Otter would be priced,</li>
              <li>The CE Mark approval process,</li>
              <li>MTTS' existing equipment suite,</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <h3>DtM: Device design</h3>

          <p>My team was brought in to refine DtM's proof-of-concept into a more functional and robust prototype because DtM did not have the bandwith or technical expertise to make Otter a reality, </p>


          <p>DtM was responsible for the original Otter concept, and provided </p>

          <p>I kept MTTS and DtM in the loop with weekly progress emails, and team-wide calls to discuss specific issues.  We also visited them once a semester.</p>
