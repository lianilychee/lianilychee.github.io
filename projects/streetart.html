        <p>GUERILLA STREET ART<br>
        Cambridge, MA<br>
        Summer 2015

        <p>I planned and executed these two projects with my good friend and summer roommate, Celine Ta. <br><br>

        <h1>PROJECT I<font color='white'>.</font color>: MODICA WAY SPRAYPAINTING</h1>
        <p>Modica Way is Central Square's ever-changing street gallery for the public, by the public.  This alley was en-route to my summer workplace, so I passed it twice-daily.

        <p>One time, I saw <a href='http://modica-way.tumblr.com/image/122710946556'>this image</a> being executed.  I particularly liked how the artist - a freelance photographer, as I discovered through conversation - created depth and shadow by using multiple makeshift stencils (overhead transparencies with cutouts).  Yet despite the detail of the armyman's uniform, his face was intentionally a single-color smear to capture how removed we are from war.

        <p>One weekend in July, in two hours, my roommate and I left this:

        <p>MESSAGE:  My roommate and I weren't smartphone users, and so we noticed how a majority of the people we passed to and from work were so engrossed with whatever was on their pocket computers.  We felt that this <b>smartphone addiction</b> was increasing how out-of-touch people were with their environments.  Live music and free food samples were all ignored.

        <p>EXECUTION:  This scaled up iPhone 5 measures 9' across.  Straight lines were guided by a length of string and two strips of tape and created by spraying on one side of a flattened cardboard box.  For the rounded edges, we used scaled-up cardboard quarter-circles that we measured and cut ourselves.  We also had cutouts for the button and the speaker.

        <p>MY COMMENTARY:  Although we were awed by Modica Way's blast of color, we intentionally chose white and dark grey to throw what we were conveying into stark relief.  I wish there were a paint that could decrease the color saturation of whatever surface it is applied upon.  If we had that, I would have opted to desaturate 2' all around the phone to further underscore how dull the real-world seems to the smartphone-addicted.


        <h1>PROJECT I<font color='white'>.</font color>I<font color='white'>.</font color>: DECORATING STREET SIGNS</h1>

        <p>In August, we added character to ~30 pedestrian crossing street signs in the residential areas of Central Square and Porter Square.

        <p>We weren't trying to make any sort of statement with this project, but we were curious about a few matters.  Would people notice us?  How would they react?
